    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning of word is the representation or idea conveyed. Word embeddings are numerical representations of the words to make computers understand natural language. The idea is to have similar words or words used in similar context to be close to each other in higher dimension space.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we look at using word vectors, let us look at classical NLP approach, Wordnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wordnet\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wordnet is a lexical database encoding parts of speech and tags relationsships between words including nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. \n",
    "- English Wordnet hosts over 150000 words and over 100000 synonym groups(synsets)\n",
    "- Synset is a set of synonyms\n",
    "- Each Synset has a definition which tells what the synset repesents\n",
    "- Each Synonym in a Synset is called a Lemma.\n",
    "- Synsets form a graph and are associated with another synset with a specific type of relationship\n",
    "- Following are the relationship types\n",
    "    - Hypernym of a synset carry a general, high level meaning of a considered synset. For e.g. Vehicle is a hypernym of synset car. It forms `is-a` relation\n",
    "    - Hyponym of a synset carry a more specific meaning of a synset. Toyota Car is a Hyponym of a car. It forms `is-a` relation\n",
    "    - Holonym are synsets that make up the whole entity of the considered synset. If is a `made-of` relation. For example, Tyre has a holonym cars.\n",
    "    - Meronym are opposite of Holonym, they form a `is-made-of` relation.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a distributed word representation learning technique. It has the following advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its representation is not subjective like Wordnet\n",
    "- It doesn't lose context like one hot vector representation does\n",
    "- It's vector size doesn't depend on the size of the vocabulary unlike one hot encoding or cooccurance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of Word2Vec is to capture the context of the word by looking at the surrounding words. Context means the a finite number of words before and after the center word of interest.\n",

    "Mathematically, the following probability should be high given the center word i.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(w_{i - m},... w_{i - 1}, w_{i + 1}, ...w_{i + m} \\vert w_i)\\: = \\: \\prod_{j = i - m \\wedge j \\ne i}^{i + m} P(w_j \\vert w_i) $\n",

    "###### Designing the Loss function for learning word embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "We see the above probability if what we try to maximize. To a neural network the loss function $J(\\theta)$ will thus minimize the negative of the above probability.\n",

Thus giving is N - 2m different probabilities. The summation precisly adds up all these probabilities values amnd dividing by the possible values gives the mean.\n",
    "Since the probability is to be maximized and in general while optimizing the weights of a neural network we minimize, we add the negative sign.\n",

    "- We next find the $logit(x_i)\\:=\\:z_i \\cdot W + b$ where W is the weight matrix of dimension $D \\times V$ and b is the bias vector of dimension $V \\times 1$. The output are logits of dimension $1 \\times V$\n",
    "- We then use softmax layer to generate our prediction $\\hat{y_i}$ where $\\hat{y_i}\\:=\\:softmax(logit(x_i))$\n",
